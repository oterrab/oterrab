## Hello 👋, is there anybody in there?

I'm Lucas Barreto, a learning data scientist based in Brazil. I consider myself a curious, creative and self-directed individual. I also like to turn data into insights. These qualities make an excellent match for a data scientist, a job that will never be about doing the same thing, but will push me to solve problems creativily and allow me to express what I've learned.

## 💡 Core Competencies
**Languages:** SQL, Python, R. <br/>
**Skills:** Data Cleaning and Wrangling, EDA, Data Visualisation, Data Analysis, Relational Databases.
