## Hello 👋, is there anybody in there?

I'm Lucas Barreto, a learning data scientist based in Brazil. I consider myself a curious, creative and self-directed individual. I also like to turn data into insights. These qualities make an excellent match for a data scientist, a job that will never be about doing the same thing, but will push me to solve problems creativily and allow me to express what I've learned.
